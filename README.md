# Library management system

This is a simple library management system that allows a librarian to:
1. Search for books, based on title, from the database.
2. Withdraw books for members using a valid book and member ID.
3. Return said books to the library using valid book ID.
4. Finally, provide a recommendation list of books for users based on their Genre or Author preference.

This program was made for the Coursework part of the **'Introduction to Programming' (21COA122)** module in Loughborough University.
